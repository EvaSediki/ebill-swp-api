# Meeting notes

## To be discussed

### Should the API support all business cases?

The _Alternative Procedure Parameters_ defined by SIX only define a mapping from a QR-bill to `B` (bill) or `R` (reminder).

### What type of attachments should the API support for PDF/A-3 uploads?

1. No attachment; information is extracted from the QR-code of the QR-bill.
  * Multipage documents?
  * Multiple QR-codes?
2. XML-eBill attachment.
3. XML-ZUGFeRD attachment (GS1).
4. TXT-QR attachment.

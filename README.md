# ebill-swp-api
The **eBill Software Partner API** defines an interface used to deliver *electronic invoices*
from an ERP to an _eBill Network Partner_ (as defined by SIX).

## Status
This repository should be considered as _work in progress_. It shows what direction such an API
could take. It is provided here only as a general information of the workgroup's reflections.

You are welcome to comment and/or discuss on the API by the way of _GitHub issues_.

## API definition
The API definition can be found as a Swagger YAML-file in folder `api` and viewed, for instance,
with an online tool such as [swagger.io](https://editor.swagger.io).
